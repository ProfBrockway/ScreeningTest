# ScreeningTest:  PROGRAM PURPOSE.
#
#   Medical screening tests vaunting a very high "general accuracy" can give
#   staggering levels of false results when the prevalence of a disease is low.
#   This program explores the effect the prevalence of an infection in a
#   population on the usefullness of screening tests. The goal is to
#   demonstrate that the Epidemiology of screening tests is complex and 
#   they are usually less reliable than commonly supposed.
#
# Inputs:
#        A GUI asks the user to enter the following medical test statistics.
#          Population: 
#          Test Sensitivity:
#          Test Specificity:
#          Start of Prevalence Range.
#          End of Prevalence Range:
#          Prevalence of Interest:  
#          CheckBoxes allowing the plotting of different statitics.
#
# Outputs:
#        (1) A plot with:
#           x axis. A range of disease prevalances.
#           y axis:
#                  Positivie Predictive Value. (PPV)
#                  Negative Predictive Value. (NPV)
#                  False Positives (FP)
#                  False Negatives (FN)
#                  General Accuracy (ACC) (A somewhat misleading item !)
#                  Prevalence of Interest (PREVINT ) (A Vertical line).)
#        (2) A table of the generated data used to create the plots.
#        (3) A video tour of the app and its features
#
# Features:
#       All outputs can be saved to the users local computer, viewed full
#       screen or browsed from the GUI
#           This is true of the entire projects code.
#  
# Result Verification:
#    Our graphs seems correct.  See a similar one at:
